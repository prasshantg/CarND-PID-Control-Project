I followed https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/41330/1493863065/pid_control_document.pdf for tuning parameters.

Method used: Manual

Values started from Kp = 0, Ki = 0, Kd = 0

1. Started increasing Kp in multiple of 0.1 until the oscillations
2. After that started increasing Kd until very less oscillations observed
3. Has to try multiple combinations of Kp and Kd for first two steps
4. Then started increasing Ki until the drive was smooth

Effects of parameters
- Increasing Kp caused overshoot at the start only
- Keeping Kp low caused overshoot near bridge where CTE becomes high
- Increasing Kd helped to fix overshoot but increasing it too much also caused overshoots

I also tried using PID controller for speed but did not get enough time to tune it.
